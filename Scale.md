# Scale Azure SQL Database

With a single database, you determine the amount of resources that the database requires to handle its workload at the service tier, performance level, and amount of storage it requires. 

## Manage single database resources using the Azure portal

To set or change the service tier, performance level, or storage amount for a new or existing Azure SQL database using the Azure portal, open the **Configure performance** window for your database by clicking **Pricing tier (scale DTUs)** - as shown in the following screenshot. 

- Set or change the service tier by selecting the service tier for your workload. 
- Set or change the performance level (**DTUs**) within a service tier using the **DTU** slider.
- Set or change the storage amount for the performance level using the **Storage** slider.
